# [0] Introduction

## What is this course?

This course aims to teach you the basics of programming in a language called C#
(pronounced See-Sharp). The goal is to have fun programming, not to turn you
into a professional developer. That said, this course will stand you in good
stead to pursue further study if that is what you want to do. At the end of the
course are a list of resources you can call on to take your learning that next
step.

## Who is it for?

The content in this course is aimed at beginners to programming. It helps if you
poses a keen desire to learn, and don't mind the frustrations that often come
with doing that! It doesn't matter if you do something badly at first; what
matters is you do it. Time and effort will make you better.

I suggest keeping a "development diary" of your progress. Periodically look back
at this, and if you must compare yourself to someone, compare yourself to an
earlier version of yourself - never anyone else.

### What will I need?

You'll need a Windows or MacOS (Apple) computer. The tool we use to learn C# is
called LinqPad, and it only runs on those types of computer at present.

### What should I know?

You should know how to:

- Download and install new programs to your computer.
- Use your computer's file explorer program.
- Run programs on your computer.
- Navigate menus in a program.

## How to use the examples

Each example should be typed in exactly as it appears in the listing. Each space
and punctuation character matters! Be as precise as you can. Mistakes will
happen though - even for experienced programmers. If you encounter an error,
start by checking your code against that of the listing. Chances are you made a
typo or missed a character somewhere.

Once you have a working example, read the explanation of it below the listing.
Take it at whatever pace you need. If a section doesn't make sense to you,
re-read it until it does. Resist the temptation to skip ahead to the next
section.

Once you have read and understood the explanation, you can move on to the set of
exercises for that listing. These will typically get you to change your listing
in various ways to produce different program output. Try each exercise as many
times as you need to get a working solution. Programming is often about
perseverance!

When you have exhausted an example, you are ready to move on to the next.
